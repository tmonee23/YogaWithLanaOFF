During my Expat life in Jakarta I came closer to Yoga and then I found in Lana such a wonderful Yoga teacher who really changed my life in many ways. To learn more about my body and what my body is able to do is still a great experience and miracle to me. Yoga is a way of teaching the colors of life to me every day. It challenges me, helps to stay flexible and fit, gives me inner peace, the strong will to go on and reach more. And it transformed my body into a great looking shape. Yoga is now a very important thing in my life and I try to practice every day! Thank you Lana, Namaste:-)  ",

When I think of you, I think of the word ‚Äúpeace‚Äù and ‚Äù acceptance‚Äù and it makes me smile. You have guided me through a yoga life that is very different from what I have experienced before. You have shown the importance of spirituality within yoga and this has allowed my thoughts and perspectives to change in the past two years! You have given me inspiration to live out some of my dreams that i otherwise may have passed over as ‚Äújust my hobby‚Äù. Good Luck with your next adventure in life! I am sure whatever it brings, you will bring to it light and good energy.",

I stepped into the unknown territory, but the way you taught us yoga was irresistible for me and I have followed with joy your lessons until today. I became passionate about yoga and included all what I had learned into my morning procedure after swimming. Yoga became my habit every morning and my life changed. Every day starts with the fresh and peaceful mind since then. I am sad that you are leaving, but I am grateful for having been your student for years! I will miss you and your lessons but you will remain in my mind and with me every morning when I am practicing yoga. Thank you for all you have taught me! This is one of the main valuable gifts I ever received!",
